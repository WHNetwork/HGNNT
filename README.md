# DHG-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Deep Hypergraph Learning (ICLR 2026)

DHG-Bench is an open and unified pipline for Deep Hypergraph Learning (DHGL) based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Geometric](https://www.pyg.org/). We embark on **17** state-of-the-art hypergraph neural network (HNN) algorithms in node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks and analyze their performance in **22** distinct hypergraph datasets.

DHG-Bench provides a fair and comprehensive platform to evaluate existing HNN algorithms and facilitate future DHGL research. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

* DHG-Bench enables a fair and unified comparison among 17 state-of-the-art HNN algorithms
and 22 diverse hypergraph datasets covering node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark for deep hypergraph learning.

* We conduct a systematic analysis of HNN methods from various dimensions, including effec-
tiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. Through extensive experiments, we reveal both the
strengths and limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights to inform and inspire
future research in this field.

* We release DHG-Bench, an easy-to-use open-source benchmark library to support future DHGL
research. Besides, with our toolkit, users can readily evaluate their algorithms or datasets with
less effort.

## <span id="installation">📦 Installation</span>

Follow the steps below to install and configure **DHG-Bench** properly for your local environment.

**Installation for Local Development:**

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Coco-Hut/DHG-Bench.git 
cd DHG-Bench
```

**Download Datasets**

All benchmark datasets are available on the Hugging Face Dataset Hub:

https://huggingface.co/datasets/Philley/DHG-Bench-dataset

After downloading `data.zip` from the Hugging Face repository, extract it via:

```bash
unzip data.zip
```
to obtain the data directory. The project structure should look like the following:

```bash
DHG-Bench
  ├── data
  │   ├── fair_data
  │   ├── hete_data
  |   ├── hgcls_data
  │   ├── trad_data
  |   └── ...
  └── dhgbench
  │   ├── main.py
  │   ├── parameter_parser.py
  │   ├── lib_dataset
  │   ├── lib_models
  │   ├── lib_utils
  └── └── ...
```

**Required Dependencies:**

**DHG-Bench** needs the following requirements to be satisfied beforehand:

* Python>=3.9.21
* Pytorch>=2.2.2
* torch_geometric>=2.6.1
* torch-cluster>=1.6.3
* torch-scatter>=2.1.2

## <span id="quick-start">🚀 Quick Start</span>

The following commands show how to quickly run an existing HNN algorithm across different hypergraph tasks.

For example, to run the HGNN method on the Cora dataset for a node classification task, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --dname=cora --task_type=node_cls --method=HGNN --is_default=True
```

For example, to run the EDHNN method on the Pubmed dataset for a hyperedge prediction task, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --dname=pubmed --task_type=edge_pred --method=EDHNN --is_default=True
```

By default, `edge_pred` uses the original DHG-Bench protocol for backward compatibility. To evaluate a held-out hyperedge prediction protocol where validation/test target hyperedges are removed from the message-passing hypergraph, use:

```bash
python main.py --dname=pubmed --task_type=edge_pred --method=EDHNN --is_default=True --edge_pred_protocol=observed --edge_split_mode=trand
```

In `--edge_pred_protocol=observed`, DHG-Bench assigns at least approximately 60% of the canonical dataset hyperedges to training and divides the remainder as evenly as possible between validation and test. The training partition is expanded when necessary to cover every node that participates in a canonical hyperedge, so its realized proportion can exceed 60%. The complete training partition is used both as the message-passing hypergraph and as supervised training positives, while validation/test positives remain structurally held out. Method-required self-loops and AllSet graph transformations are applied only to the training message-passing graph and never become prediction labels. Model-specific preprocessing is then constructed from this training graph only. Negative sampling excludes all true dataset hyperedges.

Perturbations are not supported by the `observed` edge-prediction protocol. Combining `--edge_pred_protocol=observed` with `--is_perturbed=True` raises an error; use the `legacy` protocol for existing perturbation experiments.

For example, to run the TFHNN method on the stream_player dataset for a hypergraph classification task, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --dname=stream_player --task_type=hg_cls --method=TFHNN --is_default=True
```

Note that The **is_default** parameter indicates whether to use the model’s default configuration. If set to False, the model will instead load parameter settings specific to the given dataset. All model parameter files are provided in the lib_yamls directory.
